## my roblox fflags config
- no mean to exploit nor doing anything here, this are my fflags that works best for my machine.
- This config repo is for the app Sober (Roblox runtime on Linux using Android translation layer and they DO NOT have any affiliation with Roblox).
- For W*ndows, take the middle part.
## About
- This config will improve the performance on linux machines that runs on Intel Graphics based chip:
  - This config will reduce the graphics to lowest
  - No data will be collected to avoid bans from Roblox via disable telemetry (I hope so)
  - AND NO, NO HACKS OR CHEATS IN THIS CONFIG
 
have fun with it!
